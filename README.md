**1**) [Insurance Data Analysis](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Data-Analysis-SQL-Projects/tree/main/Insurance%20Analysis.)

The dataset for this project consists of toy data that I personally created. I conducted a thorough analysis on this data to comprehend patterns and trends. In the course of this analysis, I applied several standard SQL functions including GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, etc. This approach enabled me to gain valuable insights from the dataset.
